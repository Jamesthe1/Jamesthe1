Hi there! I'm a programmer that develops software and mods.

# Personal
I'm a person with a passion for logic, often willing to optimize and get creative. In a team, I often see myself as a leader, encouraging and triaging with others to reach our goals.

Video games and technology are hobbies of mine, and sometimes I'll be willing to write mods for them. Space games especially catch my attention.

# Mods
I mainly develop mods for the games RimWorld and House of the Dying Sun (my works are on [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/hotds/p/Jamesthe1/)). These are mainly utility, though creativity does come to me.

# Software
I develop standalone software and games as well. Though these projects are sometimes under wraps, some do come to fruition and succeed.
